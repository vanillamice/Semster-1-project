# Semster-1-project
Simple script applying cantor's pairing rule.
# Basic functionality
Added GUI using tkinter, made sure input validation is as expected both in CLI and GUI versions
Functionalities:
You are required to implement two functions:
1.A function that takes two positive integers as arguments and calculates and returns the encoded result z
2. function that takes a positive integer as an argument and calculates and returns the two decoded numbers.
The functions should check if the passed arguments are positive integers, otherwise,
displays an error message and keep taking input from the user while the input is invalid.
